Both dishes, though equally delicious, are completely different from one another. It's one of the many reasons I love eggplants-they're so versatile and can be cooked in such different ways to yield such different results. Serve the stew either as a hearty starter or a side, or else as a main, served with any grain you like.

    "description": "This is a dish I regularly cook for friends. All the work is done in advance—you can marinate it for up to 2 days in the fridge—and then it's just into the baking pan and into the oven when you're ready. The chicken loves the long marination but it can also be cooked straightaway, if you don't have the time. If you're going to do this, just season the chicken with the I tsp of salt and pepper (which would otherwise go into the marinade), rubbing it thoroughly into the skin before combining it with the rest of the marinade ingredients (no more salt required) and bake according to the recipe. I like to use chicken legs but others prefer chicken supremes (chicken breasts with the wing bone attached), which also work very well. Thanks to Julee Rosso and Sheila Lukins's The Silver Palate, whose recipe for Chicken Marbella inspired this recipe.",

    "description": "If you get hooked on this simple supper dish and I believe the chances are pretty good-make an extra batch of the seed and breadcrumb mix. It keeps well in an airtight container for about I month and is really useful to have on hand. It works as well on strips of white fish or sticks of butternut squash as it does on the chicken."

The trout needs to be as fresh as can be, the nuts need to be best quality (always taste them to check for freshness), and the salt flaked. If you can get hold of them, use slivered pistachios—their long shape is very elegant and their vibrant green looks great—but regular shelled pistachios, roughly chopped, are also fine. This is as easy to make as it is impressive to serve.",

If you want to make the tahini sauce, just blitz 3 tbsp/50g tahini, 1/2 cups/30g parsley, 1/2 crushed garlic clove, 2 tbsp lemon juice, and 1/8 tsp salt for 30 seconds and pour in 1/2 cup/120ml water. Adding the water last allows the parsley to get really broken up and turns the sauce as green as can be. This sauce is lovely spooned over all sorts of things-grilled meat and fish and roasted vegetables, for example-so double or triple the batch and keep it in the fridge. It keeps well for about 5 days. You might want to thin it with a little water or lemon juice to get it back to the right consistency. These fritters are a bit of a fridge-raid, using up whatever herbs you have around. As long as you keep the total net weight the same and use a mixture of herbs, this will still work wonderfully. The batter will keep, uncooked, for I day in the fridge. Alternatively, pile the fritters into pita bread with condiments, such as a combination of yogurt, chile sauce, pickled vegetables, and tahini. You'd just need one fritter per person, rather than two.",

    "description": "I've managed to achieve the seemingly impossible here, of taking a recipe from my NOPI cookbook (full of recipes that would not make it into Ottolenghi SIMPLE) and actually making it more complicated for Ottolenghi SIMPLE. In NOPI, the celery root is roasted whole as it is, for 3 hours, brushed with oil and sprinkled with salt. The results are so delicious and so straightforward that I've taken the liberty of adding one more twist in the form of the coriander seeds. The taste is even more wonderful than before. I like to eat it as it is as a starter, cut into wedges and served with a squeeze of lemon or a dollop of crème fraîche, but you can also serve it as a side to a pork chop or steak."

Adding aromatics to your cooking water is a great way to jazz up mash. I've used thyme, mint, lemon, and garlic here, but try experimenting with different herbs and spices. Get ahead by peeling and cutting the potatoes up to 6 hours in advance if you like. Just keep them in a pot of cold water and drain before starting the recipe.",

Either way, don't throw them away—they bring a great extra crunch to an already fresh and crunchy salad and they turn this into a dish you can get onto the table in less than 30 minutes. This is totally brilliant alongside the Slow-cooked chicken with a crisp corn crust (page 236).\nAll the elements can be made in advance: the dressing up to 3 days and the potato skins can be kept in a sealed container for I day at room temperature.

Beat on high speed for 3-4 minutes, until light, then lower the speed to medium. Add the eggs, in small additions, scraping down the sides of the bowl. The mix may separate a little, but don't worry; it'll come back together. Add the flour, salt, baking powder, and almond meal in three additions. Finally, fold in three-quarters of the blueberries, scrape into the prepared loaf pan, and smooth it out evenly.",
      "Bake for 15 minutes, then sprinkle the remaining blueberries over the top of the cake. Return to the oven for another 15 minutes, until the cake is golden brown but still uncooked. Cover loosely with foil and continue to bake for about 30 minutes, until risen and cooked. Test by inserting a knife into the middle; it's ready if it comes out clean. Remove from the oven and set aside, in its pan, to cool for 10 minutes, then remove from the pan and place on a wire rack to cool completely.",
      "Meanwhile, make the icing. Put the remaining I tbsp of lemon juice into a bowl with the confectioners' sugar and whisk until smooth. Pour over the cake and gently spread out the blueberries on the top of the cake will bleed into the icing a little, but don't worry; this will add to the finished look."
